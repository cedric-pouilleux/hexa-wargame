# ThreeJS hexagonal environment for game


A 3D interactive sandbox scene, offering a dynamic and customizable environment. The hexagonal grid, generated using procedural noise, simulates natural terrain with mountains and valleys. Half-hexagons have been added to achieve a perfect square shape. A realistic water surface, utilizing advanced shaders for reflections and textures, covers the lower areas. Interactivity includes real-time hexagon selection through a raycasting system. The tiles have been optimized to ensure a steady 75 FPS performance. Immersive lighting is provided by a directional light simulating a dynamic, rotating sun.
